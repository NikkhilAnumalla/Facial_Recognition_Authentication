# Facial_Recognition_Authentication
This project implements a real-time face recognition system with anti-spoofing detection using Dlib, OpenCV, FAISS, and Streamlit. It extracts face embeddings from images, stores them in a database, and then performs real-time recognition using a webcam while preventing spoofing attacks.
